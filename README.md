#HTML to PDF Converter#

A simple HTML to PDF converter (iText under the hood). It employs Apache Velocity in order to build dynamic HTML code and then generate a PDF file out of it.

PS: iText (or my lack of skill) won't get you far regarding page styles (CSS) as shown on the page above. However, using table layout should do the trick, as iText demonstrates fair CSS support to cells.
